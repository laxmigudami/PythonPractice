polymorphism refers to the ability of a real-time object to represent itself in many forms.
Consider yourself as a real-time example. When you are at college, you act as a student.
When are at your home, you act like a child. You are a single person,
but you represent yourself differently in different places.

Similarly in the OOPs concept,
polymorphism refers to the ability of a method to process objects differently depending on their data type or class

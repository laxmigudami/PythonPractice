Under the concept of OOPs, class and object are the important components that are used to implement the rest of the OOPs concepts.
So in this article, let us explore more about classes and objects in Python.

For example, in the real world, there can be thousands of cars in use.
 All cars will have four wheels, an engine, steering, etc. Since each car was built from the same set of blueprints,
they contain the same components. In object-oriented terms, we say the car as an object and blueprint of the car as a class.

Objects in Python:
Objects are real-world entities. Each and every object will have certain attributes (properties) and behaviors (actions).
For example, color, length, width of a car are attributes and actions like driving, applying brakes, etc
can be referred to as behaviors.

In order to define attributes, we use variables and to define behaviors, we use methods.


Classes in Python:
A class is a design or a blueprint for which objects are created. Similar to how a single blueprint is used to design
different brands of cars, a single class is used to create more than one object.

Since a class acts as a blueprint to create an object, we need to create a class before creating an object.
So, let us see how to create a class.
#class is created by using the keyword 'class'. Below is the syntax for creating the class.

Syntax
class class_name:

eg: class Car:
#Creating Objects In Python


An object created for a class inside the main() method is used to access variables and methods defined inside the class.
Below is the syntax for creating the object.

Syntax
object_name = class_name()
